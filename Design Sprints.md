Almost everything around you started off as a design problem or design challenge.

**Design sprint**
	A time-bound process, with five phases typically spread over 5 full 8-hour days.
	The goal of the design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

**Design sprint benefits**
	- Save time
	- Create a path to bring a product to market
	- Prioritize the user
	- Test product before launch

### **Phases of a Design Sprint**
A traditional design sprint lasts five days, with each phase taking up to one full day. The whole process is super hands on.

**Phase 1 - Understand**
	Sets your sprint on the right track and helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge.
**Phase 2 - Ideate**
	Coming up with ideas and building off of them to create solutions. Each participan takes time to sketch and present their ideas. The idea is what matters.
**Phase 3 - Decide**
	Decide which solutions you want to build, your team discusses each possible solution, and eventually decides on the one solution that is most likely to excite users and increase sales.
**Phase 4 - Prototype**
	At the end of this phase, you don't need a finished product, just something realistic enough to test with users. Schedule users testing.
**Phase 5 - Testing**
	As users test your prototype, you observe how they react and then interview them about their experiences. Your team gains critical insight about changes that need to be made before you launch a final version.

### **Planning a Design Sprint**

- User Research
- Call the experts
- Find the right space - All need to have the resources to make their job
- Gather supplies
- Establish sprint rules
- Plan introductions - Icebreakers 
- Post-sprint planning - Documentation
