As a *<span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">type of user</span>*, I want to *<span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">action</span>*, so that *<span style="font-style:italic; color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">benefit</span>*.

Type of user = Who we are designing for.
Action = What the user hopes will happen.
Benefit = Why the user wants the action to happen.

A user story with a happy ending.

**Edge case**
A rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience. Good UX anticipates edge cases an reroute users back to the happy path.

#### **Spotting & resolving edge cases**
- Create personas and users stories
- Thoroughly review the project before launch

#### **User Journey**
The series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal.

Think of it like reading a book... If the persona is your character, the user story is your plot and the journey map is your story outline.
