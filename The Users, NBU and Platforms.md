NBU - We need to have on constant focus the Next Billion Users that will have his first interaction with the Internet.

According to this, we need to considerate 4 points.
- **Cost.** Low RAM and Limited Storage.
- **Connectivity.** Problems with the connectivity. 
- **Digital Literacy.** The users might not know how to use a phone. Keep it simple, add tutorials.
- **Literacy in general.** Some users aren't able to read or write or the keyboard isn't the right one for the user. Japanese for example.

Even though UX Designers need to think across platforms, it's important to focus on one platform first when you build a new product. This platform should be the one that best meets your end user's needs.

To have a consistent user experience across platforms it's also important to have a consistent brand identity.

**Brand identity**
	The visual appearance and voice of a company.

**Responsive Web Design**
	Allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device.

**A few best practices when designing for mobile user experiences:**
- Call-to-action buttons should be placed front and center, allowing the user to easily complete the desired task.
- Navigation menus should be short and simple.
- Use gestures that users already do, like tapping and swiping (intuitive and familiar to users).
- Design for both directions a phone might be held (vertical and horizontal view).
- Reduce visual clutter, mobile phones have smaller screen sizes, keep it simple.

**The four C of multi-platform design.**
	***Consistency***: Keep design elements like colors, fonts, and icons the same across all platforms for a familiar and easy-to-use experience.
	***Continuity***: Ensure users can seamlessly switch between platforms without losing their progress or data.
	***Context***: Adapt the design to suit the specific device and situation in which the user is interacting.
	***Complementarity***: Design each platform to enhance and add value to the others, leveraging their unique strengths.
