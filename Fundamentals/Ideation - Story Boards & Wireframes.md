**Empathy map**
An easily understood chart that explains everything designers have learned about a type of user. This maps help UX Designers understand a user's behavior when interacting with a product.

**Personas**
Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. As you're ideating, it's a good time to reference the personas you created to help you remember who you're designing for.

**User story**
Fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.

**User Journey**
The series of experiences a user has as they interact with your product.

**<span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(199, 143, 255)">Together, empathy maps, personas, user stories and user journey maps help us create a problem statement, or a clear description of a user's needs that our design should address.</span>**


**Research-Based Ideation**
- Good design isn't random; it relies on research, user feedback, and observation to understand user needs and challenges.
- Design ideas should stem from real user research rather than assumptions to ensure you're addressing actual user needs.

**Defining the Problem Statement**
- A problem statement clearly outlines the user's need that your app aims to address.
- It should include a fictional user's name, characteristics, needs, and a key insight derived from research.

	**Example:**
		As the owner of a new construction company, Sawyer is looking for ways to network with other professionals in the industry. They believe that networking can help them gain more clients and learn from more experienced construction company owners. To build these networks, Sawyer wants to research all the trade conferences in their local area.
		_
		[Sawyer] is a [construction company owner] who needs to [attend local trade conferences] because [they need to network to gain more clients].

#### **Goal Statements**

**Why Goal Statements are Important**
- Goal statements bridge the gap between the user's problem and the solution your UX design offers.
- They provide clarity and direction for your design process.

**Elements of a Strong Goal Statement**
- Clearly outlines a specific action users can take or what your product will do.
- Identifies who will be positively impacted by your design solution.
- Explains how the action or product addresses the user's need and its positive impact.

**Crafting Your Goal Statement**
- Start with your problem statement, user personas, user stories, empathy maps, and user journey maps.
- Use the provided template to structure your statement effectively.
- Ensure your statement is concise, specific, and focuses on user benefits and measurable outcomes.

#### **User Flow**

The path taken by a typical user on an app or a website, so they can complete a task from start to finish.

#### **Storyboards**

**Big-Picture Storyboards**
- These storyboards illustrate the user's journey with a product, emphasizing the "how" and "why" of their experience.
- They capture emotions and highlight pain points, helping you understand the user's needs and motivations.

**Close-Up Storyboards**
- These storyboards zoom in on the practical aspects of the design, focusing on the "what" of the user interface.
- They detail specific interactions within the product, such as screens, buttons, and navigation flow.

**Choosing the Right Storyboard**
- Big-picture storyboards are ideal for early-stage design to get stakeholders excited and aligned on the user's needs.
- Close-up storyboards are more useful later in the design process to refine the product's functionality and user interface.

Here's why creating both is beneficial:

- **Comprehensive understanding:** Big-picture storyboards ensure you're solving the right user problem and addressing their motivations. Close-up storyboards refine the solution by detailing the user interface and interactions.
- **Effective communication:** Big-picture storyboards are great for pitching ideas to stakeholders and getting them excited about the user-centric vision. Close-up storyboards help developers understand the specific functionalities and flow of the product.
- **Early identification of usability issues:** By visualizing the user journey at both a high level and a detailed level, you can spot potential pain points and areas for improvement early on, saving time and resources in the long run.

#### **Wireframes**

**Design Fidelity**
- **Fidelity** in UX design refers to how closely a design matches the final product's look and feel.
- **Low-fidelity (Lo-Fi)** designs are simple and used for quick brainstorming and exploration, while **high-fidelity (Hi-Fi)** designs are more polished and resemble the final product.

**Wireframes: A Low-Fidelity Design Tool**
- **Wireframes** are basic outlines of a digital experience, using lines, shapes, and some text to represent the structure and content.
- They help establish the page structure, highlight the product's intended functions, and save time and resources during the design process.

**Getting Started with Wireframing**
- You don't need to be an artist to create effective wireframes. The goal is clear communication, not artistic merit.
- Wireframing is a learned skill that improves with practice. Start simple and gradually increase complexity.

**Building Blocks of Wireframes**
- Wireframes consist of three primary elements: lines, basic shapes (like squares and circles), and text.
- These elements represent various components of an app or website layout, such as buttons, images, and text blocks.

**Industry Standards and Your First Wireframe**
- Familiarize yourself with industry standards for representing elements like text, images, and calls to action.
- Now it's your turn! Grab a pen and paper and try creating a wireframe for a simple app or website.

Remember, the goal is to organize and communicate your design ideas effectively. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for you!
