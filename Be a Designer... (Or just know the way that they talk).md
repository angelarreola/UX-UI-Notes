**User**
	Any person who uses a product

**End User** - Your main priority
	The specific audience a UX designer creates something for

Think of it like this... Cars is an animated movie about talking cars... was designed with kids ages 5 to 7 in mind. Those kids are the movie *End Users* but adults an teenagers will be the audience too. So they are also *Users*.

**User experience**
	How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or expecting, a product.

**Goals of a good user experience**
- Is the product easy to use?
- Is the product equitable?
- Does the product delight the user?
- Does it solve the user's problem?

**User-centered design**
	Puts the user front-and-center, considering their story, emotions and the insights you've gathered about them.
	Following the next framework helps us build products people actually want to use.
	
	Understand

**Five elements of UX design**
	Steps a designer takes to turn an idea into a working product.

	Strategy
		Define the user's needs and business objectives.
	Scope
		Determine what you are building. You'll decide on features and content to
		 be included in the product.
	Structure
		How you organize your design and how the user's interacts with it.
	Skeleton
		Detail how the design works. The user won't see these inner workings.
	Surface
		How the product looks to the user.

**Design thinking**
	A way to create solutions that address a real user problem and are functional and affordable.

	Empathize
		Discovering what the end users really need. 
	Define
		Create a problem statement. Based on user research.
	Ideate
		Aim to come up with as many ideas as possible.
	Prototype

	Test
		Test the prototypes with users. Gives users an opportunity to provide
		 feedback before the product is built.
