**Why Paper Prototypes?**
- **Advantages:** Paper prototypes are cost-effective, enable rapid iteration, involve low commitment, encourage honest feedback, and promote collaborative brainstorming.
- **Disadvantages:** They can be difficult to interpret, are limited to in-person testing, and pose challenges for remote teams.


**Implicit Bias in UX Design**
- Implicit biases are unconscious beliefs that influence our perceptions of others, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in various contexts, including UX design.
- For example, designing a map app solely for walking New Yorkers ignores those who use other transportation methods or have disabilities, highlighting how implicit bias can exclude user groups.

**Creating Inclusive User Experiences**
- Personas and user journey maps are essential tools for inclusive design, representing diverse user groups and their needs.
- Thorough user research helps challenge assumptions, uncover diverse user needs, and create products that cater to a wider audience.

***Remember, recognizing and addressing our implicit biases is crucial for building equitable and inclusive products that benefit everyone.***
