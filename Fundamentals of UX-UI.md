## Product development life cycle

→ The process used to take a product from an idea to reality.

**First Stage:** Brainstorm → Generating ideas about the user and potential need or challenges the user might have. Research plays a key role in this first stage because you’re exploring different ways to get to know the audience you’re designing for.

**Second Stage:** Define → Using the insights from the brainstorm stage and starting to narrow the focus. Who the product is for, what the product will do and what features need to be included for the product to be successful.

**Third Stage:** Design → Implementing insights into new designs using various tools. Using the insights from the first two stages, UX Designers generate designs that keep the user top of mind.

**Fourth Stage:** Test → Evaluating the product design based on the feedback of potential users. This is a stage that involves lots of interaction between UX Designers and Front-end Engineers as they figure out ways to create an end product that satisfies users needs and is practical and functional.

**Fifth Stage**: Launch → Sharing a finished version of the product with the public. The work on a product isn’t quite finished after launch, you may still identify opportunities to improve on the designs or learn even more about the user experience based on feedback.
