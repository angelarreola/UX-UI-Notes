#### **Why UX Research is powerful and useful**
UX Research is powerful and useful because it ensures that even a child who can't read can intuitively use a product by understanding and addressing diverse user needs and behaviors.

Focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.
#### **How to give peer review feedback**
- Understand the activity
- Provide descriptive feedback
- Pick two or three things you liked about their work
- Pick two or three things that can be improved with actionable advice
- Be respectful and kind (Don't say things like "You need to..." or "This is wrong")

#### **How to receive peer review feedback**
- Stay open-minded
- Remember your goal
- Keep your own agency

#### **Design Research and Qualities of a UX Researcher**

**Foundational research answers the questions:**
- What should we build?
- What are the user problems?
- How can we solve them?

**Design research answers the question:**
- How should we build it?

**Post-launch research answers the question:**
- Did we succeed?

**UX Researcher qualities**
- Empathy: Able to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation
- Pragmatism: Focused on reaching goals
- Collaboration: Can work with a range of people, personalities, and work styles.

#### **Types of Research**

**Qualitative Research**: Focuses on understanding user behaviors, motivations, and attitudes through methods such as:
- **User Interviews**
- **Usability Testing**
- **Field Studies/Ethnographic Research**
- **Diary Studies**
- **Focus Groups**
- **Card Sorting**

**Quantitative Research**: Involves collecting and analyzing numerical data to identify patterns and measure user behavior through methods such as:
- **Surveys and Questionnaires**
- **A/B Testing**
- **Analytics and Metrics**
- **Eye Tracking**
- **Heatmaps**

Both types of research are essential in creating a comprehensive understanding of user experiences and informing design decisions.

#### **Biases and how overcome them**

##### **Confirmation bias**
Occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have.

**Overcoming**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Actively listen
- Include a large sample of users

##### **False Consensus bias**
Overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design

**Overcoming**
- Identifying and articulate your own assumptions
- Survey large groups of people

##### **Recency bias**
It's easiest to remember the last thing you heard

**Overcoming**
- Take detailed notes or recordings
- Interview each participant in the same way

##### **Implicit bias**
The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.

**Overcoming**
- Reflect on our own behaviors
- Ask others to point out our implicit biases

##### **Sunk Cost bias**
The deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course

**Overcoming**
- Break down your project into smaller phases
- Outline points where you can decide whether to continue or stop.

#### **Empathize**

**Empathy**
The ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation.

**The Importance of Empathy in UX Design**
- Understanding users' feelings and thoughts through empathy is key to creating great user experiences.
- Empathetic design leads to products that anticipate and meet users' needs, resulting in higher user satisfaction and engagement.

**How to Empathize with Users**
- Ask users open-ended questions starting with "what," "how," and "why" to gain insights into their needs and desires.
- Observe users' interactions with your product, paying attention to their verbal and nonverbal cues to understand their experience fully.

**Empathy vs. Sympathy**
- While often confused, empathy and sympathy are distinct concepts. Empathy involves understanding and even feeling users' emotions, while sympathy is showing concern without necessarily experiencing those emotions.

##### **Empathy Maps**

**Understanding Empathy Maps**
- Empathy maps are visual representations of user data, helping UX designers understand user needs and pain points.
- They break down interview transcripts into digestible pieces, organizing information about what users say, think, do, and feel.

**Building Empathy Maps from Interviews**
- The reading uses the example of Makayla, a dog owner struggling to find consistent and reliable dog walking services.
- Through her interview transcript, we learn her needs and frustrations, which are then categorized within the empathy map.
