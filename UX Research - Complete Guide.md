#### **Biases and how overcome them**

##### **Confirmation bias**
Occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have.

**Overcoming**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Actively listen
- Include a large sample of users

##### **False Consensus bias**
Overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design

**Overcoming**
- Identifying and articulate your own assumptions
- Survey large groups of people

##### **Recency bias**
It's easiest to remember the last thing you heard

**Overcoming**
- Take detailed notes or recordings
- Interview each participant in the same way

##### **Implicit bias**
The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.

**Overcoming**
- Reflect on our own behaviors
- Ask others to point out our implicit biases

##### **Sunk Cost bias**
The deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course

**Overcoming**
- Break down your project into smaller phases
- Outline points where you can decide whether to continue or stop.
