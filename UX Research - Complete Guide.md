#### **Why UX Research is powerful and useful**
UX Research is powerful and useful because it ensures that even a child who can't read can intuitively use a product by understanding and addressing diverse user needs and behaviors.

Focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.
#### **How to give peer review feedback**
- Understand the activity
- Provide descriptive feedback
- Pick two or three things you liked about their work
- Pick two or three things that can be improved with actionable advice
- Be respectful and kind (Don't say things like "You need to..." or "This is wrong")

#### **How to receive peer review feedback**
- Stay open-minded
- Remember your goal
- Keep your own agency

#### **Design Research and Qualities of a UX Researcher**

**Foundational research answers the questions:**
- What should we build?
- What are the user problems?
- How can we solve them?

**Design research answers the question:**
- How should we build it?

**Post-launch research answers the question:**
- Did we succeed?

**UX Researcher qualities**
- Empathy: Able to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation
- Pragmatism: Focused on reaching goals
- Collaboration: Can work with a range of people, personalities, and work styles.

#### **Types of Research**

**Qualitative Research**: Focuses on understanding user behaviors, motivations, and attitudes through methods such as:
- **User Interviews**
- **Usability Testing**
- **Field Studies/Ethnographic Research**
- **Diary Studies**
- **Focus Groups**
- **Card Sorting**

**Quantitative Research**: Involves collecting and analyzing numerical data to identify patterns and measure user behavior through methods such as:
- **Surveys and Questionnaires**
- **A/B Testing**
- **Analytics and Metrics**
- **Eye Tracking**
- **Heatmaps**

Both types of research are essential in creating a comprehensive understanding of user experiences and informing design decisions.

#### **Biases and how overcome them**

##### **Confirmation bias**
Occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have.

**Overcoming**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Actively listen
- Include a large sample of users

##### **False Consensus bias**
Overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design

**Overcoming**
- Identifying and articulate your own assumptions
- Survey large groups of people

##### **Recency bias**
It's easiest to remember the last thing you heard

**Overcoming**
- Take detailed notes or recordings
- Interview each participant in the same way

##### **Implicit bias**
The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge.

**Overcoming**
- Reflect on our own behaviors
- Ask others to point out our implicit biases

##### **Sunk Cost bias**
The deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course

**Overcoming**
- Break down your project into smaller phases
- Outline points where you can decide whether to continue or stop.

#### **Empathize**

**Empathy**
The ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation.

**The Importance of Empathy in UX Design**
- Understanding users' feelings and thoughts through empathy is key to creating great user experiences.
- Empathetic design leads to products that anticipate and meet users' needs, resulting in higher user satisfaction and engagement.

**How to Empathize with Users**
- Ask users open-ended questions starting with "what," "how," and "why" to gain insights into their needs and desires.
- Observe users' interactions with your product, paying attention to their verbal and nonverbal cues to understand their experience fully.

**Empathy vs. Sympathy**
- While often confused, empathy and sympathy are distinct concepts. Empathy involves understanding and even feeling users' emotions, while sympathy is showing concern without necessarily experiencing those emotions.

##### **Empathy Maps**

**Understanding Empathy Maps**
- Empathy maps are visual representations of user data, helping UX designers understand user needs and pain points.
- They break down interview transcripts into digestible pieces, organizing information about what users say, think, do, and feel.

**Building Empathy Maps from Interviews**
- The reading uses the example of Makayla, a dog owner struggling to find consistent and reliable dog walking services.
- Through her interview transcript, we learn her needs and frustrations, which are then categorized within the empathy map.

**Identifying Pain Points**

- "Unspoken" pain points are issues users experience but may not articulate. As a UX designer, you need to be able to identify these unspoken pain points.
- Pain points can be categorized as financial, product-related, process-related, or support-related.

**Defining the Problem**

- Use the "6 Questions Framework" (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) to gather information about the user and the context of their pain points.
- This framework helps you empathize with the user and understand their needs.

**Creating a Problem Statement**

- A problem statement summarizes the user's needs and the challenges they face.
- A good problem statement helps to focus the design process on solving the user's problem.

**From Problem Statement to Solution**

- After defining your problem statement, you need to brainstorm potential solutions, similar to forming a hypothesis in research.
- In UX design, these potential solutions are written as hypothesis statements, which are educated guesses about how to solve the design problem.

**Writing Hypothesis Statements**

- You can use an "if-then" statement format: "If [user action](https://www.coursera.org/learn/primeros-pasos-en-el-proceso-de-diseno-de-ux-empatizar-definir-e-idear/lecture/xOOwk/define-planteamientos-de-hipotesi), then [desired outcome](https://www.coursera.org/learn/primeros-pasos-en-el-proceso-de-diseno-de-ux-empatizar-definir-e-idear/lecture/xOOwk/define-planteamientos-de-hipotesi)."
- Alternatively, you can use a more flexible format to express the solution to the user's need.

**Adapting Your Hypothesis**

- Remember that hypothesis statements can be adjusted throughout the design process as you gather more insights about your users.
- Stay flexible and adapt your hypotheses to arrive at the best design solution.

**What is a Value Proposition?**

- It's the core reason a user would choose your product over others.
- It answers: "What does my product do?" and, more importantly, "Why should the user care?"

**Identifying Potential Value Propositions**

- Brainstorm features your product could offer, even if they seem ambitious at this stage. Don't limit yourself with implementation details yet.
- Categorize these features based on the needs of your different user personas.

**Tailoring to Specific Users**

- Prioritize the value propositions that directly address the primary needs of each user persona.
- For example, a user focused on quick workouts would value machine reservations, while a user struggling to get into popular classes would prioritize a class booking feature.

#### **Ideation**

**Ideation Basics:**
- Ideation is the process of generating a wide range of ideas without judgment, aiming for quantity over quality.
- It encourages exploring even seemingly "crazy" ideas, as they can lead to unexpected and effective solutions.

**Ideation in Practice:**
- UX designers brainstorm individually or in diverse groups, documenting all ideas without immediate evaluation.
- Taking breaks after brainstorming allows for fresh perspectives when evaluating ideas later.

**Evaluating Ideas:**
- Ideas are assessed based on feasibility (technical possibility), desirability (solving user needs), and viability (business benefits).

#### **Competitive Audit**

**What you can learn from a competitive audit:**

- You can identify direct competitors, who offer similar products to the same audience, and indirect competitors, who either target a different audience or offer different products.
- Competitive audits help you understand the existing market landscape by analyzing a range of competing products.

**Benefits of competitive audits in UX design:**

- They provide insights into design approaches used by competitors, helping you make informed decisions.
- You can identify usability challenges in competitors' products and avoid them in your designs.
- Competitive audits can reveal unmet user needs, presenting opportunities for your product to fill those gaps.

**Example:**
Let's say you're designing a mobile banking app. You conduct a competitive audit and notice that most existing apps focus heavily on features like checking balances and transferring funds, but none of them offer a straightforward way for users to track their spending habits and set budget goals within the app. This gap represents an unmet user need – the need for better financial management tools integrated into the mobile banking experience. By identifying this through your competitive audit, you've uncovered a potential opportunity to differentiate your app and attract users who prioritize budgeting and financial planning.

**The Importance of Innovation**

- Focusing too heavily on competitors can hinder your own creative process and innovation.
- Use competitor analysis as a starting point to fuel your own unique design solutions.

**Data Interpretation and Applicability**

- Accurately interpreting data from competitive audits is crucial for success.
- Designs should cater to your specific user base, even if a feature works well for a competitor with a different audience.

**Staying Updated**

- Competitive audits should be conducted regularly to stay informed about competitor updates and new players in the field.

##### **Steps:**
**Setting the Stage**
- Clearly define the goals of your audit, specifying the product aspects you'll compare, such as customer reviews or pricing options.
- Create a spreadsheet listing 5-10 direct and indirect competitors to get a comprehensive view of the market landscape.

**Gathering and Analyzing Information**
- Identify the specific aspects of the products or services you want to compare, aligning them with your audit goals.
- Conduct thorough research on each competitor, noting their strengths, weaknesses, and how well they meet the target audience's needs.

**Drawing Conclusions**
- Analyze the collected data to identify trends and themes across your competitors.
- Summarize your findings in a clear and concise report, using visuals like screenshots and charts to support your analysis.

Think of your goals as the "why" and the aspects as the "what" of your audit. If your goal is to improve customer satisfaction with your checkout process, the aspects you analyze should relate directly to that goal. For example:

- **Goal:** Improve customer satisfaction with the checkout process.
- **Aspects to Compare:**
    - Ease of navigation
    - Clarity of payment options
    - Number of steps to complete a purchase
    - Availability of guest checkout

By focusing on these specific aspects, your analysis will provide actionable insights into how your competitors handle their checkout processes, ultimately helping you achieve your goal of improving customer satisfaction.

#### **How Might We? | Sketching | User Paths** 

**What is the "How Might We?" Exercise?**
- It encourages exploring multiple ideas instead of settling on one solution.
- It emphasizes collaboration and open-ended possibilities.

**Crafting Effective "How Might We?" Questions:**
- Focus on the user's needs while leaving room for innovative solutions.
- Generate multiple questions to explore a problem from various angles.

**Remember:** The "How Might We?" exercise is a tool to help you think differently about user needs and discover a wide range of potential solutions.

---
**Why Sketching Matters**
- Sketching allows for quick visualization and exploration of numerous ideas without the constraints of technology.
- It helps designers iterate rapidly and capture fleeting thoughts, leading to more innovative solutions.

**The Crazy Eights Exercise**
- This exercise involves folding a paper into eight sections and sketching a different idea in each section, spending one minute per idea.
- Its purpose is to generate a variety of solutions for a given problem statement within a short timeframe.

**Benefits and Next Steps**
- Crazy Eights encourages divergent thinking and helps designers break free from conventional solutions.
- Sharing your sketches for feedback and practicing with different problem statements can further enhance your ideation skills.

---
**User Needs and Design Solutions**
- Considering the specific needs of the user, like the child's age and abilities, is crucial when designing a solution. What works for a toddler might not work for an infant or an older child with special needs.
- The user's environment also matters. A design solution suitable for a city might not be practical for rural areas.

**Iterative Design Process and Portfolio Building**
- It's okay to revisit your research and gather more data if you encounter new challenges or realize you need more information about the user's needs.
- Documenting your design process, including user research, problem definition, and proposed solutions, is valuable for your portfolio and demonstrates your UX design thinking.
