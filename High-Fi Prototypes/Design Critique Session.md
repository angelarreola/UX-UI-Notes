**What is a Design Critique Session?**
- A design critique session is a planned meeting where UX designers present their work to team members for feedback to collectively decide on a design direction.
- These sessions are valuable for receiving diverse perspectives, improving designs, and enhancing teamwork.

**Roles in a Design Critique Session**
- The facilitator guides the session, ensuring objectives are met and everyone's input is heard.
- The presenter shares their design work and actively engages with feedback.
- Reviewers provide constructive criticism and suggest improvements.

**Structure of a Design Critique Session**
- The facilitator starts by outlining the session's objectives and goals.
- The presenter then presents their design work, and reviewers take notes.
- Reviewers share their feedback, and the presenter can ask clarifying questions.
- Finally, the facilitator summarizes key takeaways and ensures all objectives are addressed.

Keep in mind that this is just one structure, and different teams may have variations.

#### **How to use feedback from a design critique to make practical changes to your designs in Figma. Let's recap what we learned:**

**Addressing User Flow Feedback**
- The designer created alternative screens to address a user flow concern about single dog owners, making the experience smoother.
- They ensured all buttons in the user flow had consistent heights and widths, creating visual harmony.

**Refining Design Elements**
- The placement of buttons was reviewed for consistency, ensuring a predictable user experience.
- Icon designs were simplified based on feedback, resulting in a cleaner and less cluttered interface.

**Prioritizing Accessibility**
- The color contrast of the orange hue was checked for accessibility using WebAIM, and a darker shade was chosen to meet AAA standards.
- The designer demonstrated how to efficiently update the color of multiple elements simultaneously in Figma, saving time and ensuring consistency.
