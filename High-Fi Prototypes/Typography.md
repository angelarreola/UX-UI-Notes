**Understanding Type Basics**
- **Type Classification:** This is a broad way to categorize type styles, with Serif (like Times New Roman) and Sans Serif (like Arial) being two common examples. Serifs have small lines at the ends of strokes, while Sans Serifs do not.
- **Typeface:** This refers to the overall design style of a set of characters, distinguished by features like stroke weight and shape. Think of typeface as the "family" a font belongs to.

**Choosing and Using Fonts**
- **Font:** This is where you get specific with the size, weight (like bold or light), and emphasis (like italics) of your chosen typeface.

- **Digital Typography:** While Sans Serif fonts were once preferred for digital readability, advancements in screen technology now allow for the use of Serif typefaces in web and app design.


#### **Typography for Hierarchy and Readability**

- Designers use typography to create a visual hierarchy, guiding users to the most important information on the page, similar to how headlines in newspapers or titles in books stand out.
- Easy-to-read typography is crucial for good UX, ensuring that all users, including those with visual impairments, can easily understand the content.

**Typography and Brand Identity**
- Typography plays a key role in communicating a brand's identity, and designers often adhere to brand guidelines that dictate specific typeface choices.
- Google, for example, uses its custom typeface, Google Sans, across its products and marketing materials to reinforce its brand identity.
