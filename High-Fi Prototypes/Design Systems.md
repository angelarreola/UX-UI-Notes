**What is a Design System?**
- A design system is a centralized collection of reusable elements, guidelines, and standards that streamline the design and development process.
- It acts as a single source of truth for a company's brand guidelines, UI patterns, code snippets, and more, ensuring consistency across all products and platforms.

**Components of a Design System**
- Visual styles: Defines the core visual elements like typography, color palettes, and iconography, ensuring brand consistency and enhancing user experience.
- Guidelines: Outlines design principles, editorial guidelines, and implementation rules for using components and styles, promoting consistency and clarity.
-  UI patterns: Includes elements, components, modules, and templates, providing a hierarchical structure for building user interfaces.

**Benefits of Design Systems**
- Design systems ensure consistency by limiting design choices, leading to a unified user experience and brand identity. For example, using a specific shade of orange for buttons across an app.
- They enhance brand identity by maintaining visual consistency across a company's products, like Google's use of specific colors, fonts, and rounded corners.

**Design Systems in the Workplace**
- Design systems improve scalability, making it easier to iterate on designs as a product grows and onboard new designers.
- They boost efficiency by providing clear design specifications, reducing questions and speeding up the design process.

- **Shared Language and Understanding:** Design systems establish a common vocabulary for design elements and their implementation. This shared understanding reduces miscommunication and back-and-forth between teams.

- **Streamlined Workflow:** With a design system in place, developers can work concurrently with designers, pulling in approved components and styles as they become available. This parallel workflow speeds up development and reduces bottlenecks.

**Design System Fundamentals**
- Design systems ensure consistency and efficiency in design. You can use pre-built components and customize them to match your brand.
- Material Design's elevation system adds depth to the interface, while states visually communicate the status of interactive elements.

**Using Material Design in Figma**
- The Material Design UI kit in Figma provides preset styles, a sticker sheet with pre-made components, and a components page for building your mockup.
- You can customize pre-existing components like the bottom navigation bar by detaching instances and swapping icons and text.
