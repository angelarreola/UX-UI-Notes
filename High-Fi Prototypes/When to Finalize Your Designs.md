Here are the three questions to ask yourself to determine if your designs are ready to be finalized:
- **Are the designs a true representation of the intended user experience?** The designs should accurately reflect the intended user experience and meet users' needs.
- **Have placeholder text, icons, and imagery been replaced with finalized assets?** All visual elements should be finalized and ready for implementation.
- **Are participants or users able to interact with and interpret the designs without external guidance?** The designs should be clear, intuitive, and easy to understand for users.

- Time and money are important but shouldn't be the deciding factors in finalizing designs.
- Focus on whether the designs accurately represent the user experience, have finalized assets, and can be used without external guidance.

Handing Off and Iterating

- Sending your designs to engineering can feel daunting, but remember that most designs undergo updates post-launch.
- UX design is iterative, and as you gain experience, you'll become more comfortable with the handoff process.
