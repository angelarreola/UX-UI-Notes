**From Sketches to Digital Design**
- Start your design process with sketches to brainstorm and visualize your ideas.
- Transfer these sketches into a design tool like Figma or Sketch to create digital versions.

**High-Fidelity Design and its Importance**
- High-fidelity design involves adding details like colors, text styles, and images to your mockups.
- These detailed designs serve as a communication tool for the engineering and product teams to understand the final product vision.

**The Design Journey**
- When designing, focus on the user's journey and the key steps they take to achieve their goal.
- High-fidelity designs help in visualizing and refining this journey, ensuring a smooth user experience.

#### **Foundational Elements**

- **Typography** involves the use of text and fonts to enhance readability, establish hierarchy, and convey visual style. For instance, the title on the Wizard of Oz movie poster uses a larger font size to highlight its importance, while the font choice reflects the movie's playful nature.
- **Color** is another crucial element, prompting designers to consider the message each color conveys, how people perceive it, and how colors interact with each other. The color wheel, a familiar tool from art class, helps UX designers identify harmonious and complementary color combinations.
- **Iconography** uses images or symbols to represent a subject or idea. Think about the power button on your computer; it's a simple circle with a line, but it's universally understood to mean "power" on tech devices.

**Importance of Usability**
- While visual design is important, UX designers prioritize usability above all else. Any decisions made about a product's visual design should always keep the user's ease of use in mind.
- We'll delve deeper into each of these elements in subsequent videos.
