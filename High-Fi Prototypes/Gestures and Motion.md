**Gestures and Motion Defined**
- A gesture is any touch-based interaction a user has with a device, such as tapping, scrolling, swiping, or zooming.
- Motion uses animation to bring static design elements to life, guiding the user's attention and illustrating changes on the screen.

**How Gestures and Motion Improve UX**
- They provide visual feedback, making it clear that an action has been taken, like a cart icon animating when an item is added.
- They create a more engaging and intuitive user experience, such as the familiar swipe gesture to turn pages in an e-book.

**Interaction Details in Figma**
- **Triggers:** Triggers initiate the prototype's progression, such as a click, tap, or time delay.
- **Actions:** Actions define what happens after the trigger, like navigating to another frame.
- **Destinations:** Destinations specify where the prototype should go after the action, which could be another screen.

**Animations in Figma**
- **Animation Selection:** Figma offers various animations, like "Instant" for immediate transitions or "Slide In" for smoother transitions.
- **Direction Control:** For animations like "Slide In," you can control the direction from which the new screen appears.
- **Enhancing Navigation:** Using opposite animations for opening and closing actions (e.g., "Slide In" and "Slide Out") can make navigation feel intuitive.

**Alternative Options to Gestures**
- Always provide alternatives to gestures because some users may not be able to perform them due to disabilities or other factors.
- For instance, allow users to select an archive button instead of relying solely on swiping to archive an email.

**Motion Speed and Duration**
- Be mindful of the speed and duration of motion in your designs, as very fast or prolonged animations can be disruptive or confusing.
- The W3C recommends animations be under five seconds, and in Figma, transitions should ideally be between 150 to 500 milliseconds.

**User Control Over Motion**
- Give users the ability to control motion, such as turning off looping animations like GIFs or autoplay, which can be distracting.
- YouTube's option to toggle autoplay is a good example of providing user control.
