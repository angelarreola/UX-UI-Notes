**Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Prototypes**
- Low-fidelity prototypes use placeholders for content and focus on basic layout and structure.
- High-fidelity prototypes closely resemble the final product with detailed design elements, realistic content, and interactive functionality.

**Essential Elements of High-Fidelity Prototypes**
- **Visual Elements:** Include realistic images, typography, icons, and written content.
- **Navigation:** Ensure smooth transitions between screens with clear buttons and icons, allowing users to navigate the app intuitively.

**Interactivity in High-Fidelity Prototypes**
- Add interactive elements like buttons, links, and animations to simulate user experience and test functionality.

**Preparing Your Design**
- You can create your prototype within the same Figma file as your other design elements.
- Organize your screens according to the user flow, which is the intended path a user takes through your app.

**Connecting the Screens**
- Use the prototype mode in Figma to link screens together.
- The first connection you make serves as the starting point for your prototype, so ensure it aligns with the initial user action.
