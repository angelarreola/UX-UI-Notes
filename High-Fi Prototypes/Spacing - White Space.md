**What is White Space?**
- White space, also known as negative space, refers to the empty areas between elements in a design.
- It's not necessarily white; it's just the space between design elements.

**Why is White Space Important?**
- **Emphasis and Clarity:** White space helps draw attention to specific elements, like a call-to-action button, by providing visual breathing room.
- **Grouping and Organization:** Elements placed close together appear related (proximity principle), while white space separates unrelated items, improving organization.
- **Readability and Comprehension:** Ample white space between text and visuals makes content easier to scan and understand, enhancing the user experience.
