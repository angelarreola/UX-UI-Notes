- **Start with user research:** Before even designing, conduct user interviews or surveys to understand user needs and pain points.
- **Prototype and test early:** Create low-fidelity prototypes to get initial feedback on your design's flow and functionality.
- **Conduct usability testing:** Test your prototypes with real users, observe their interactions, and gather feedback on what works well and what could be improved.
- **Iterate based on feedback:** Analyze the feedback you receive and prioritize changes based on user impact and project feasibility.
- **Don't be afraid to make changes:** Sometimes, even significant changes might be necessary based on user feedback. Embrace iteration as a chance to improve your design!

Remember, designing with the user in mind leads to more successful and user-friendly products!

#### **(Example with a Dog Walker App)**
**Updating the Date Selection Feature**
- Participants in a usability study found it difficult to schedule dog walks in advance using the existing date picker wheel, so the instructor replaces it with a calendar pop-up.
- The instructor demonstrates how to create a new screen in Figma with a calendar component, using a pre-made design from the Figma community to save time.

**Improving Price Transparency**
- The instructor addresses feedback that users were not aware of the price of a dog walker until the end of the booking process.
- To improve transparency, the price per dog walker is added to the homepage and other relevant screens, allowing users to compare prices upfront.
