- Emphasis is about making certain elements stand out to guide the user's attention.
- In visual design, we use visual weight to create emphasis, achieved through size, color, contrast, etc.

**Why is Emphasis Important?**
- Emphasis helps users understand the relative importance of elements on a page.
- It guides users towards taking desired actions, like clicking a button.

**How to Use Emphasis Effectively**
- Consider the user's goals and what you want them to focus on.
- Use visual cues like color, size, and contrast to highlight important elements.

Imagine a button that allows users to purchase a product. If that button is small, bland, and blends in with the background, users might overlook it.

However, if you make that button stand out by using a contrasting color, increasing its size, or surrounding it with whitespace, it immediately draws the user's eye. This visual prominence encourages users to notice the button and click it, thus guiding them towards the desired action of making a purchase.

Essentially, emphasis acts as a visual signpost, leading users towards the most important actions on the page.

#### **<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">What is Hierarchy?</span>**
- Hierarchy is a visual design principle that organizes elements on a page based on their importance, guiding the user's attention.
- It uses visual cues like size and color to distinguish important elements, helping users understand where to focus first.

**Why is Hierarchy Important?**
- In UX design, hierarchy ensures users can easily navigate an app and find relevant information quickly.
- It helps prioritize actions by highlighting the most important buttons or elements, streamlining the user journey.

**Hierarchy and Accessibility**
- Hierarchy is crucial for users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.
- Accessibility annotations in mockups ensure elements are read and interacted with in the correct order, improving accessibility for all users.
